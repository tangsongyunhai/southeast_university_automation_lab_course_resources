我是邹滨阳，东南大学自动化学院2022级本科生，自动化专业，智能感知方向，学号08022305。
## 仓库目的
本仓库主要针对的是自动化专业繁杂的实验报告，希望通过分享这些报告能够给自动化专业的学弟学妹们提供参考。同时针对部分重合的实验课比如数电模电，也可以供其他专业的同学们借鉴学习。  
另外衷心推荐同学陈鲲龙整理的自动化学院课程资料，参考[东南大学自动化学院课程资源仓库](https://github.com/JimmyChenkk/Southeast-University-School-of-Automation-and-Control-Science-course-resource/tree/master)  
同时如果你是东南大学的学生，也可以参考自动化学院学生会整理的[云盘资料1](https://pan.seu.edu.cn/#/home/groupdoc/autolearn%20hub)和[云盘资料2](https://pan.seu.edu.cn/#/home/groupdoc/autolearnhub_2)

## Author
I am Zou Binyang, an undergraduate student of the 2022 cohort at the School of Automation, Southeast University. My major is Automation, with a focus on the Intelligent Perception track, and my student ID is 08022305.
## Purpose of the Repository
This repository mainly focuses on the numerous lab reports for the Automation major. It is hoped that sharing these reports will provide references for junior students in the Automation major. Meanwhile, for overlapping lab courses such as Digital Electronics and Analog Electronics, it can also serve as a reference for students from other majors to learn from.  
Additionally, I sincerely recommend the Automation School course materials compiled by fellow student Chen Kunlong. For reference, please visit [the Southeast University School of Automation and Control Science Course Resource Repository](https://github.com/JimmyChenkk/Southeast-University-School-of-Automation-and-Control-Science-course-resource/tree/master).  
Meanwhile, if you are a student of Southeast University, you can also refer to the [Cloud Drive Materials 1](https://pan.seu.edu.cn/#/home/groupdoc/autolearn%20hub) and [Cloud Drive Materials 2](https://pan.seu.edu.cn/#/home/groupdoc/autolearnhub_2) compiled by the Student Union of the School of Automation.
